			<h3 class="topic-h">Which character do I pick?</h3>

			<div>
				<p>Now that you have a grasp of Melty Blood's way of play, it is now time to put these to the test, but you need to pick your character first and foremost. In this section of the guide, we will give you an overview of Melty's vast character pool to help you pick the perfect character.</p>
			</div>

			<h3 class="topic-h">Aggressive Characters</h3>

			<div class="clear">

					<figcaption>Nanaya's fastfall</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>These style of characters are, as its name suggests, prefer to shove theirselves to their opponent's face and forcing them to predict and think ahead of the opponent through the use of "mix-ups" (a set-up where the opponent must either guess or react on which move is next because of the aggressor's many options).</p>
				<p>Prominent characters who are into this style of play are Nanaya, Sion and V-Sion (of any Moon).</p>
				<p>Nanaya is a great character to start with for this playstyle and Melty Blood in general, due to his easy combos and simple to execute mix options, while still remaining at a solid tier that can compete against other characters. He, by all means, is not generic however, as he possesses a fastfall move that makes his air movement even more ambiguous.</p>
				<p>Sion delivers a different level of pressure than other characters, but she has a high execution barrier at mid to high levels of play due to her famous "kyaa loop" combos that optimizes her damage even more.</p>
				<p>V-Sion is similar to Sion, but offers a more "rushdown" playstyle, trading Sion's neutral for more pressure power.</p>
			</div>

			<h3 class="topic-h">Neutral Dominance</h3>
			<div>
				<p>In this style of characters, the neutral phase is their kingdom. They excel in forcing the opponent to always be on either offense or defense depending on their moveset. They do not necessarily have to have the best and strongest pressure, or the most unbreakable of defenses, but it is difficult to switch between the two states because even if you escape their pressure, these characters will just force you back to the corner. Even if you break their defenses, they have another hidden shield ready for your next attack.</p>
				<p>These characters dominate in neutral in many different ways. Those like Nero and Wara have enormous hitboxes and summons that catch anyone getting in their way, while those like Aoko and C-Seifuku have versatile projectiles for both offense and defense that discourages enemy rushdown and allows them to slowly push in.</p>
				<p>If you like to control the pace of the game, not caring about throwing in more damage than your opponent in one combo, but rather chipping them off the more mistakes they make, then this style is for you.</p>
			</div>


			<h3 class="topic-h">Setplay</h3>
			<div class="clear">
				<figure class="floatl border">
					<img src="../images/setplay.png" width="370px" height="250px">
					<figcaption>Kohaku's 22C cactus - one of her many hard-to-beat </figcaption>
					<figcaption>options for okizeme (knockdown) setplay</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>This style of play is the general style for the "mixup" style that we have encountered earlier. It revolves around "manipulating the opponent" to set-up a preplanned play. This is commonly known in other fighting game communities (albeit jokingly) as "flowchart characters", due to the "if-else" style of play of these kind of characters.</p>
				<p>This is by no means "unskilled", in fact all characters exhibit a flowchart of some way. What makes these characters different is their very large flowchart, allowing for many tools to use in different situations, and many things your opponent has to keep track of. This is what also makes setplay characters difficult - evident by the character pool of this playstyle filled with one of the hardest characters in the game. The player must learn everything that these characters can do and cannot do, having really low strength on amateur level, but being a living hell for your opponent if mastered. Setplay dominant characters include Akiha, Kohaku, White Len and Hisui.</p>

			<h3 class="topic-h">High Execution, Flashy and Cool Charas</h3>

			<div class="clear">
				<figure class="floatr inline-b">

					<figcaption>most damaging combos in Melty Blood</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>Now, if you're itching for a thrill of a learning experience, or you just want to style on your opponents, then this one is totally for you. These types of characters are not only on the most insane of skill requirement but also make you pull off the coolest of Melty Blood's combos. They are not necessarily weak by any means, because they still have their own strengths to make them able to compete against the highest tier characters. Remember, all 150+ different characters and their Moon Styles are viable in the highest level of play (except for those in the next category).</p>
				<p>Compared to the other categories, those in this level are mostly gonna have specific Moon Styles with them. Characters in this line-up include C-Roa, F-VAkiha, Arcueid, high/combo video level C-Aoko and P.Ciel.</p>

			<h3 class="topic-h">Joke Character</h3>
			<div class="clear">

				<figure class="floatl border">
					<img src="../images/neco.png">
					<figcaption>Do they look like serious characters to you?</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>There are 2 characters in this game whose sole purpose is to tilt your opponent as much as possible, and its these two small cats at the left, nicknamed the "Necos".</p>
				<p>It doesn't take much to know they don't look like something you should be playing seriously (unless you are really dedicated into getting as much potential as possible from these two), so if you really love to make your opponent so mad of the boredom, make new players pull their hairs out because they do not know how to play against these two, or you just don't really care about winning: this one's for you, I guess.</p>
