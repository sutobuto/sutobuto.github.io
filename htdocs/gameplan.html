			<h3 class="topic-h">The Three States</h3>

			<div>
				<p>Similar to other 2D fighting games, the game and its players revolve around three different states, namely - <span style="font-weight: bold;">neutral, offense and defense.</span></p>
				<p>Your general gameplan will always revolve around these 3 game states, whether it be playing a specific way when in a certain state, or using your advantages to force a specific state. Each character and Moon Style have different ways and approaches in each game state, determined by the properties of their moves. Some with slow moves with large hitboxes may prefer to stay at a far distance, while those with quick moves prefer to shove theirselves on their opponents' faces and apply endless pressure.</p>
				<p>In this section of the guide, we will cover the general goals that every player should keep in mind for each game state, no matter the character they are using.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>The neutral phase, as its name suggests, is a state where both players are not in any form of advantage - where no player is applying pressure. It is the phase of the game where both players are free to do whatever they want. This is the same as other fighting games. However, the unique thing about neutral phase in Melty Blood is its emphasis on the air as a means to get an advantage. Other games like Under Night In-Birth and Street Fighter only use the air as a secondary, riskier means of engaging and baiting enemies, while on games like Mortal Kombat and Injustice, the air is practically non-existent to players, serving no advantages to the player. Thus, majority of the neutral phase is done in the air than just moving on the ground.</p>

				<p>Neutral phase is a very complex topic to discuss, and it is very reliant on player experience. Although, we can apply certain concepts/rules in playing our neutral and creating our style of play.</p>

				<p>Unique to Melty Blood is the array of options that you have in the air compared to the ground, most especially movement options. It is a must to at least be on the air more than you are stepping on the ground, because this is where majority of neutral gameplans occur. You are given an airdash, jump and superjump in the air, plus any other kind of special move that changes air momentum, compared to only a dash and a backdash on the ground. These movement options will be the backbone of many of the things you plan to do, such as baiting high-recovery moves or repositioning to a different section of the stage.</p>

				<p>Another rule that players should definitely follow is to make as less mistakes as possible. The neutral phase is also more of a game of punishment - where a single misstep may snowball into a loss, especially against characters like Nanaya who have trouble getting in and engaging in neutral, but once they do, have insane pressure power.</p>

			<h3 class="topic-h">Offense and Defense</h3>

			<div>

				<p>Now we cover the other two game phases - offense and defense. These two are together because they come in pairs - both of the players cannot be on offense at the same time, because for offense to occur, the enemy must be blocking, and for defense to occur, you must be blocking.</p>

				<p>Compared to the gameplan of the neutral phase where you punish movement errors and whiffs, offense and defense are very reliant on frame data to make optimal counterattacks (as defense) and safe followups (as offense). This, like the neutral phase, can be learned through experience and character/matchup knowledge.</p>

				<p>Offense is exerted in the form of <span style="font-style: italic;">pressure</span> - where you simply shove yourself to the opponent's face forcing them to block as much as possible through the use of strings like frame traps (strings that bait the opponent to mash buttons at a frame disadvantage) and mixups. Different characters have different ways of exerting pressure on the opponent, like Aoko's hold orbs, Kohaku's plant setups and Ryougi's combination of high pushback, long range pressure strings. One common thing, however, is the use of a pressure string (sequence of moves used to apply pressure) and a reset move (usually the last move of the string cancelled into a special move, reverse beat whiff, or instant air dash, so as to continue exerting pressure and making it more ambiguous).</p>

				</div>


				<p>With offense and pressure comes defense and how to escape pressure. Like every other phase of the game, this also relies on your matchup experience, but there are certain options that all characters can use to get out of corner pressure.</p>

				<p>The most common option is to mash a 2 button (usually 2A) to catch dash resets. It may look like your best bet considering a lot of characters rely on dash resetting, but you also have to consider the range of options that button mashing cannot cover, such as air dash resets, frame traps and staggering (delaying the moves of a string to bait out a mash).</p>

				<p>Another option is to use your air movement to get out of corners. Jump outs will beat pressure strings that start with a 2 move (which are common on dash resets) and ground hitting specials, but will get beaten by any 5 move and characters who airdash a lot on pressure strings.</p>

				<p>A more risky but rewarding option that covers almost all kinds of offense is using your Shield and Shield Bunker. This one should only be used if the enemy's offense gets too predictable, and you know how their strings work. This is because you can only Shield high moves while standing, and low moves while crouching (an exception being the ground A moves, which can be shielded in any way). Shield Bunker, on the other hand, is usable when you have enough meter (refer to the Moon Style comparison table). Shield Bunkers almost always guarantee that you are out of their offense, since this move can be done even on block stun, but the main problem of this move, other than its meter cost, is that it is easily baitable by experienced players. Good players know which moves are commonly bunkered, such as C/H-Aoko 63214B/C, so they bait the bunker out by not doing a dash reset after the bunker'd move, making your bunker whiff.</p>

				<p>Whatever you do, <span style="font-weight: bold;">never whiff a Shield Bunker.</span> They have very, very long recovery times and they leave you very open once whiffed.</p>

				<p>Defense is a game of patience - it is ok to stay 20 seconds in the corner if you think it is unsafe to get out with your range of options, and if you still have sufficient Guard Bar.</p>
